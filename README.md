# Starlight

## User Story

As a starlight user I want to generate a constellation chart for a chosen location and know what the weather conditions will be. 

As well as, when the ideal for star-gazing is by providing the sunset and sunrise times. So that, I can go out and find exactly where a chosen constellation is above my location. 

## Description
This application works with location values, weather conditions and a variety of constellation charts. The application will work using all three sets of information in synchronisation to provide users with a constellation charted depicted by an image on the main page, expressed through their chosen location. 

The weather values will show users necessary information to determine whether they can plan a star-gazing evening. This will work alongside the surise and sunset times so users can properly plan.
